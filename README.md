# plex-blsclient
### Notes
* Stream images received from blsclient vi udp using OpenCV+Gstreamer? Look here for an example: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/70911/write-in-gstreamer-pipeline-from-opencv-in-python (the comment shows how to create a udp stream... suggested instead of tcp!)
